Algorithm 
STEP 1: Start
STEP 2: Accept co-efficients a, b and c from user
STEP 3: Calculate determinant = (b*b) - (4*a*c)
STEP 4: Check if determinant is =0, <0 or >0
STEP 5: In each case, calculate the roots, imaginary or real
	If it is equal to 0, then roots are equal and real, the root being =
	-b/2*a
	If it is greater than zero, roots are unequal and real
	root 1= (-b + (b2-4ac)1/2)/2a
	root 2= (-b - (b2-4ac)1/2)/2a
	If it is lesser than zero, roots are imaginary
STEP 6: Print the roots of the equation
STEP 7: Stop
